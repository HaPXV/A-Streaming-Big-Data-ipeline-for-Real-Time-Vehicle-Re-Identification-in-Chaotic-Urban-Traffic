# RIVF_2025___Object_ReID___Vinh_Ha
We present a deployment-ready, real-time
vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) pipeline designed for
motorcycle-dominated, non-lane urban traffic. The system
integrates Apache Kafka and Spark Structured Streaming
with modern detection, tracking, and embedding models,
enabling city-scale streaming operation with temporal-
gated FAISS retrieval and persistent metadata for analysis.
To support evaluation under realistic conditions, we re-
lease a new multi-camera dataset from Ho Chi Minh City
that captures dense occlusions and irregular flows often
missing in existing benchmarks. Our work contributes (i) a
scalable big-data Re-ID pipeline, (ii) a motorcycle-centric
dataset with reproducible evaluation, and (iii) a foundation
for practical intelligent transportation and urban security
applications in developing cities.
